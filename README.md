## Dev-Portfolio
My personal portfolio

My personal portfolio featuring examples of my work. To present to prospective employers to showcase my skills. This portfolio features 6 of my favourite projects and is a mixture of front and back-end. Two projects were completed as part of a group, which showcases my team working skills. 

It is a work in progress and as I complete more projects, I will add them to the portfolio, play around with the styling some more and increase the functionality. 

This portfolio has been created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
